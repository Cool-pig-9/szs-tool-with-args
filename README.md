# SZS-Tool
Compress and decompress SZS files with the Yaz0 compression

### What about Wiimms SZS Tool?
The problem is that [Wiimms SZS Tool](https://szs.wiimm.de/wszst/) (of which I did not make nor is it mine) is for Linux and Mac. It supports Windows, only with Cygwin. SZS Tool (this one) doesn't need Cygwin.

## Yaz0?
Yaz0, like most archives, is a compression used by Nintendo in their games from the GameCube to the 3DS.

## Compressing
- To compress, put all the files you wish to compress into a `.zip` file. This makes SZS Tool's job easier.
- Select the `.zip` file

## Decompressing
- To decompress, select a `.szs` file

## Downloads
Go to the [Release pages](https://github.com/theawesomecoder61/SZS-Tool/releases).

## Building
1. Ensure you have .NET Framework 4.5
2. Open the `.sln` in Visual Studio 2010 or later (I use Visual Studio 2012)
3. Go to `Build > Build Solution`
