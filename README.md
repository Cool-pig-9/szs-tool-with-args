## FAQ
### What about Wiimms SZS Tool?
The problem is that [Wiimms SZS Tool](https://szs.wiimm.de/wszst/) (of which I did not make nor is it mine) is for Linux and Mac. It supports Windows, only with Cygwin. SZS Tool (this one) doesn't need Cygwin. Plus, Wiimms SZS Tool only works with `.szs` from Wii games, not GameCube, 3DS and Wii U games as this SZS Tool supports.
